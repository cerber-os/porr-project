# porr-project
The implementation of the project for the course 'Parallel and Distributed Programming.

The aim of the project is to implement encryption using the symmetric 3DES algorithm in sequential, parallel programming environments using OpenMP technology and Apache Spark, and to analyze performance in these environments based on the number of text blocks to encrypt and the number of threads.
